# Imagine you need to compose a dynamic URL for every certain user with user-specific details. Suppose,
#  you want to send different URLs for 
# every user, depending on their name and profession. The base would be something like
# 
# "http://example.com/*nickname*/desirable/*profession*/profile", where nickname and profession are 
# prompts from a user and are dynamic.
# 
# Read the nickname and profession of the user from the input and print a user-specific URL. 
# Don't bother about any rules of composing the URLs and just use raw input to accomplish the task.
